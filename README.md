# Groundwater Quality Data Interpolation

Due to the limited availability of groundwater quality data in Iran, it is crucial to fill the gaps between the available data points to ensure comprehensive analysis. To achieve this, the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) method is used for interpolation, which allows us to predict and estimate the missing data points accurately. This process is vital for conducting thorough research and providing reliable information for management decisions by officials.

The interpolation and analysis were performed using the Python programming language, leveraging its powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Statsmodels to handle data manipulation and statistical modeling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Statsmodels

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels
